                <h3>About Me: From Legos to Logic Gates</h3>
                <p>
                    Confession time, I wasn't one of those kids born with a keyboard in their crib. But tinkering with Legos sparked a love
                    for building things, and that eventually translated into building digital experiences and products using code. Life took me on a couple of detours career wise: FedEx worker, Phlebotomy Instructor, Laboratory Manager. But I eventually found myself where I believe I was meant to do my best work, building software and leading teams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fast forward to today, and I'm a Senior Software Engineer diving headfirst into the exciting world of all things web development. Whether it's crafting user-friendly interfaces, wrangling
                    complex algorithms, or building robust back-end systems, I find joy in the challenge of solving problems with code. I manage the above with also being a tech lead for a team of 5. My
                    passion lies in using my skills to provide genuine value to people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But life isn't all about ones and zeros! When I step away from the screen, you'll find me crafting a new recipe, chatting with town locals at the farmer's market, or catching up on my latest book of interest. I also love the hunt of finding a new park or green space, if you have any recommendations in the Southern California area, I'm all ears!
                </p>

                        <p>As a tech lead for a team of 5, I spearhead the planning and development of critical features and modernizations. This
                        involves collaborating closely with project managers, onshore and offshore teams, UI/UX teams, and stakeholders. I ensure projects are delivered on
                        time by removing any roadblocks developers face, leveraging my technical expertise. Additionally, I mentor software
                        engineers, fostering their professional growth within the team.</p>

                        </h4>
                        <p>I led the design and development of a comprehensive React UI library that serves as the foundation for all our
                        department's React applications. I built the core components myself and managed the work of 9 engineers who contributed
                        to the library. This resulted in a 10-fold increase in developer productivity and established a single source of truth
                        for UI components, significantly reducing bugs and unintended consequences.</p>
                        
                        <p>In a separate three-month stint as interim team lead for 11 engineers, I ensured smooth operations by handling hotfixes,
                        sprint deployments, and related meetings and rituals. I also conducted code reviews and provided direct support to developers and project managers.</p>
                        
                        <p>Furthermore, I actively participated in the company's hiring process, contributing to the recruitment of several
                        engineers and UI/UX professionals.</p>

                        </h4>
                        <p>I led the front-end modernization of a large legacy application, transitioning it from PHP/JavaScript to React
                        and Laravel frameworks. This not only significantly boosted developer productivity but also yielded a vastly improved
                        UI/UX experience for our users.</p>
                        <p>Beyond technical leadership, I championed knowledge sharing within the engineering
                        department by establishing its internal documentation space. Furthermore, I actively fostered a culture of learning and
                        collaboration by initiating several bi-weekly events, including LeetCode challenges, code reviews, code jeopardy, and
                        educational sessions.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, I served as a mentor for four engineers during this period, contributing to their
                        professional development.</p>
