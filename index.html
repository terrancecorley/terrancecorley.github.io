                <h3>About Me: From Legos to Logic Gates</h3>
                <p>
                    Confession time: I wasn't one of those kids born with a keyboard in their crib. But tinkering with Legos sparked a love
                    for building things, and that eventually translated into building digital experiences and products using code. One line turned into ten, ten into a
                    hundred, and before I knew it, I was hooked on the magic of creating digital solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fast forward to today, and I'm a senior software engineer diving headfirst into the exciting world of all things web development. Whether it's crafting user-friendly interfaces, wrangling
                    complex algorithms, or building robust back-end systems, I find joy in the challenge of solving problems with code. My
                    passion lies in using my skills to provide genuine value to users and my stakeholders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But life isn't all about ones and zeros! When I step away from the screen, you'll find me crafting a new recipe, chatting with town locals at the farmer's market, or catching up on my latest book of interest. I also get a kick out of finding a new park or green space, if you have any recommendations in the Southern California area, I'm all ears!

        <p>Built in <span>Visual Studio Code</span> by yours truly. Built with good ol' <span>HTML</span>, <span>JavaScript</span>, and <span>CSS</span>. Libraries and frameworks are great, but a tad overkill for my simple portfolio site. Hosted on <span>GitHub</span> and deployed with <span>GitHub Pages</span>.</p>
