                                project.
                                Terrance's ability to rally and guide our team that had no official leader was
                                invaluable.
                                He played a vital role in planning and developing the front-end of our application,
                                solved
                                problems that stumped others, and seemed to successfully juggle several other personal
                                projects
                                while still working full-time on ours.</p>

                                -- the terminal, JavaScript, Node, add-ons to our text editors. He was always very

                                He knew where to look for errors, looked up documentation when necessary and asked for
                                help
                                when needed. It was a pleasure working with Terrance. I think anyone would benefit from
